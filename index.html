        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Ken Eno [a.k.a. Kenkichi Eno]</h2>
        <h3>Internationally successful Tokyo-born Sound Engineer exploring next stage of career<br>
          in Audio and Music Technology Masters course | University of York</h3>
        <br><br><br>
        <p> 
          In Ken’s over 10 years of experience as a sound engineer, he has participated in various and 
          internationally wide music scenes: the 2000-2010s indie rock scene in Japan and in Canada, 
          the New York jazz scene in New York City, and the underground club music scene in London.<br>
          <br>
          His thriving career led him to assume the role of the live sound engineer for Grammy Award-winning 
          musicians such as Richard Bona, Roy Hargrove, Miho Hazama, Eric Lewis for their shows in New York City.<br>
          He receives great feedback on his sound operation and earnestness from world-class jazz musicians all over the world.<br>
          <br>
          Ken’s roles extend not only as a live sound engineer but also to recording, production and event management. Ken ran 
          a basement studio named WONDER WORK STUDIO in Tokyo and has produced upcoming indie rock bands. One of the records 
          he produced was "Hitsuji Kazoeru Ookami EP" by Muchibuse which earned numerous praise from critics, radio stations 
          and record shops.<br>
          <br>
          Between 2017 and 2020, he had a position as technical manager for a live venue/night club called the “Brixton Jamm” 
          in Brixton, the heart of the South London music scene. Liaising with the venue managers, booking managers and promoters, 
          he was responsible for the whole of the  audio and visual equipment at the 4-indoor/outdoor-room venue, in addition to 
          operating sound and lighting at the live shows.<br>
          <br>
          Currently, as of 2021, he is studying innovative audio and music technology at the University of York in England to 
          further strengthen his technological knowledge.<br>

          <!--<span>　------　</span>--><br>
          What I value most is the conveyance of the realness and dynamics of music performances to the audience and 
          listeners. No matter how much technology is developed, the sound should not be artificial, but as real as possible.<br> 
          <br>
          I always stand close to musicians’ views and take great care of their sound representation in both live and recording 
          engineering, which generate great feedback not only from the musicians but also from the audience.<br>
          After over 10 years of experience in music and sound engineering, I’ve decided to dig deeper into 
          the technical aspects of sound and music.<br>
          <br>
          In 2021, I’ve enrolled myself in Audio and Music Technology masters course at University of York in England.<br>
          This intense, one-year course will equip me with advanced and state-of-the-art audio technology, such as 3D audio,<br>
          sonification and human interaction, room acoustic modelling, digital signal processing, and more.<br>          
          <br>
          With my exceptionally high aspirations, I will pour all the knowledge and techniques I have acquired from 
          borderless fields into uplifting the future of sound standard in all formats, from creative stages to lister-end environments.
